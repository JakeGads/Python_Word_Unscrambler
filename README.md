# Python_Word_Unscrambler

This application requries a dictionary to function correctly, you can make your own or download one (https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt)

This application can take in a string and from there find all combinations of that string in order to generate a list of words, these words are automatically written out to file for viewing. The better the dictionary the better the results

## Getting Started
place the dictionary in the same directory and have it named english.txt
Run with python pass to unscrambler.main() your string and it will return a list of the possible word combinations along with writing them out to a file.
